## App Structure
- In App.js, the DonationTab component serves as the parent component.
- Within the DonationTab, each element is organized into reusable components, enhancing productivity and facilitating the addition of other types of donations in the future.

## Improvement
- Possibility to wrap all DonationTabs component in one folder for better clarity.
- Each component inside DonationTabs have their own CSS file, but it may be easier to write and read code if all css link to DonationTabs where in one file only
- I wrote separate css for each type of button, but since they have similar styling, it could be a good idea to add a button className for general styling,
